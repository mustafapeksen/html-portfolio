<h1>The Best Movie According To Mustafa</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movie of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>A rare production that confuses people when watching it for the first time, but does not give the same taste when watched again.</p>
<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>A great musical movie. J.K. Simmons brings the character to life so well that, unfortunately, it is impossible not to be angry with him while watching the movie.</p>
<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>My teacher gave this movie as homework at university. When I watched the movie, I said I'm glad I watched this movie.</p>
